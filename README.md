# ⏰ Digital Clock

## ✨ Overview

This is a dynamic and visually engaging **Digital Clock** application built using **ReactJS** functional components. It leverages the `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks to achieve real-time updates every second. The clock displays the time in a **12-Hour format (with AM/PM)**.

The design features a **themed background** with high-contrast, standard white text for excellent readability against a busy visual style.
